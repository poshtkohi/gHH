# gHH Model Data Directory

This folder contains all experimental datasets used for fitting and validating the generalised Hodgkin–Huxley (gHH) model for human P2X₁–₇ and GluA1 receptors.

## Description

- All data files here represent digitised whole-cell current traces for individual receptors and agonist concentrations.
- Datasets were extracted from published figures using **WebPlotDigitizer** (https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer).
- Each file contains two columns: time and current amplitude.  
- The naming convention indicates the receptor subtype and experimental condition.

## Data Usage

- These datasets are provided to enable replication, extension, or benchmarking of the gHH model.
- For details of experimental provenance, data structure, units, and source references, **please refer to the Methods and Supplementary Information sections of the main manuscript**.
